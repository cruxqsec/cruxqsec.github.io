## Welcome!

I'm starting this blog, mainly for myself, to collect the numerous writeups I have written, 
to motivate myself to write more and to document my interests and the topics I'm researching.

The second purpose is to share some of the knowledge in case it might be of use to someone.
Here you will find writeups of my bug bounty adventures, the training machines I have solved
on platforms like [Hack the box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) (and others) and in-depth guides
or research articles about the topics of security, programming or usually both.

All the articles written here are my own. There will be no AI generated content or [AI slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop)
as the name better implies on this site.

I hope you will enjoy and if you want to discuss any of the topics you can send me an email.
